        <h2>Summary</h2>

            <p> Hey, im Rihards and let me tell you about myself.</p> 

            <p>Since childhood, i have been keenly interested in creating things, ranging from skillsets all the way to physical objects. Always trying to find out something new.</p>
        
            <p>And this has not stopped, as i have learned many great things, which have helped me in many aspects of my life. </p>

            <p>One other thing about me is that i enjoy genuenly helping people. Not for any particular reason besides doing it just because it is right. I dislike seeing people around me in trouble or misery.</p>

            <p>These two aspects are key characteristics which define me- learning to learn and helping.</p>

            <p>I see much of my life as a practice; wins, losses, good and bad- these things have shown me that there is a great deal of things to learn and practice in every kind of situation.</p>

            <p>So, as a way to practice beeing more open and putting myself out in the world to learn and help, i present my portfolio.</p>
